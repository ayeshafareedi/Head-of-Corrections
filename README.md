# Head-of-Corrections
This notebook visualizes the current head of corrections and predecessors data on all 50 states (total of a 100 records). The purpose of this was to determine if the position of Head of Corrections rotates when there is a Gubernatorial Administration change. Although, we may be able to use classification and other data analysis methods to answer this question, we can't employ any of those methods because the results would be biased given we only have about a 100 records. Therefore, this notebook contains visualizations of the trends found in our data. Some unique findings: 3 Former Head of Corrections have held this position for over 15 years, about 4 current Head of Corrections have held this position for over 10 years, and most former head of corrections have retired upon the end of their tenure.
