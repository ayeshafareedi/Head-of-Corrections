# Head-of-Corrections
This notebook contains visuals related to the current head of corrections and their predecessors. All of the visuals are created using data I collected from articles/government website on HOCs (& predecessors) from all 50 states (total of a 100 records). 

The purpose of this was to determine if there is a relationship between the tenure of the Head of Corrections' position and a change in Gubernatorial Administrations. Unfortunately, we would need atleast 2000+ records of HOCs data to answer that question using data science techniques such as classification to avoid any bias. However, we can still calculate and graph tenures for the records we do have to see any trends.

Some unique findings: 3 Former Head of Corrections have held this position for over 15 years, about 4 current Head of Corrections have held this position for over 10 years, and most former head of corrections have retired upon the end of their tenure. 

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/suggestions.
